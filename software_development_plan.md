# Software Development Plan - Golfer's Handbook*

## Purpose and Scope 

The Golfer's Handbook is a terminal application that assists amateur golfers to find local courses and manage their personal golf statistics. 

The application will consist of two main features: 
1. A searchable catalog of local golf courses. 
2. A data base that allows user profiles to be created to record and calculate the user's statistics and maintain a list of favorite courses. 

Golf is a fantastic pass time that provides relaxed physical exercise in comfortable social setting with an element of friendly competition. However, golf courses vary greatly in style and degrees difficulty, can range considerably in price and are scattered throughout the city and countryside. This creates a logistical hurdle for both newcomers to the sport or established golfers to find an appropriately suitable course on which to play. People who have never played golf before are usually hesitant to do so because they do not know which courses would be suitable for them as beginners. When people first play golf, if they play a course that is above their skill level they can quickly get frustrated and, in turn, become discouraged from repeat play. Also, because of the nature of the game, newcomers often become disillusioned when they fail to see fast and consistent improvement in their ability. Additionally, more experienced golfers who have outgrown their local golf course would also benefit from a way to find courses that offer greater challenge and require higher levels of skill. The Golfer's Handbook will be developed to encourage more people to play the sport of golf by streamlining the ability to find suitable courses and foster repeat play by visually representing a player's improvement. 

The Golfer's Handbook will feature a catalog of golf courses. The user will be able to view the entire catalog of golf course and can then select a course to view further details, such as course specific information and relevant contact details to make a booking. The user can also choose to search, using a variety of filters, for a course that meets their specific desires. A series of prompts will elicit information from the user, including desired location, price, degree of difficulty, course length and services provided. The user will then be shown a list of the courses, based on the search parameters, that are specifically tailored to their unique requirements based on skill level, location and price tag. There will also be a feature for the user to manually enter a course details that may not currently be in the catalog. 

The second main feature is the ability for a user to create a profile, maintain a list of their favorite courses and record their golfing results to monitor their progress. After playing a course, the inputs their results and over time is provided with a variety of personal statistics relating to their overall results. This will include their handicap, either overall or course specific, birdie/par/bogie counts and penalty strokes. This can be viewed as an overall statistic, or it can be the statistics relating to a specific course. The user can also add or remove any course in the catalog to their own favorites list, which will also record how many times a specific course has been played.
